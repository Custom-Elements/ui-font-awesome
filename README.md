# FontAwesome as Elements
Working with Custom Elements, I got very tired of class and overloading
`<div>`, `<span>`, and `<i>`. So, using HTML5, here are a set of elements.

```html
<icon fa-bomb/> working <spinner fa-spin/>
<stack>
  <icon fa-bomb/>
  <icon fa-ban/>
</stack>
```

##Tweaking
These are inline elements, basically think of them as special text. You want
them larger, jack up the `font-size`.
